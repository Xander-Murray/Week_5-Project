# Web Development Project 4 - Veni Vici!

Submitted by: **Xander Murray**

This web app: **Veni Vici** lets users discover random cat breeds using [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/). Each discovery shows an image, breed name, origin, temperament, and life span. Users can click on the origin of a cat to ‚Äúban‚Äù it from appearing again ‚Äî and can remove it from the ban list with another click. Clicking ‚ÄúDiscover New Cat‚Äù fetches a new, random cat that doesn‚Äôt match any banned origins.

Time spent: **6 hours** in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Application features a button that creates a new API fetch request on click and displays at least three attributes and an image obtained from the returned JSON data**
  - Displays breed name, origin, temperament, and life span
- [x] **Only one item/data from API call response is viewable at a time and at least one image is displayed per API call**
  - Each click replaces the previous cat with a new one
- [x] **API call response results appear random to the user**
  - Uses the ‚Äúorder=RANDOM‚Äù query in The Cat API
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
  - The origin attribute is clickable
- [x] **Clicking on an attribute in the ban list removes it**
  - Ban list updates instantly
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with those attributes from being displayed**

## Notes

While building the app, I learned how to:

- Filter API results dynamically with a ban list.
- Handle asynchronous fetches and retries with recursion.
- Use React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to manage API data and UI updates.
